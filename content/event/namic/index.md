summary: WSI-DICOM Improvement - From Viewer to Analysis
abstract: 'Despite various existing solutions for the conversion of WSI data into DICOM, there is a distinct lack of conversion tools (vendor agnostic) that result in DICOM files. Current solutions fall short in generating DICOM files compatible with OpenSlide (4.0.0) and OHIF/SLIM-Viewer, including a PACS, impeding seamless integration and compromising overall performance.
Our objective is to 1. assess available conversion tools, 2. examine their seamless integration capabilities, and 3. enhance or develop our own solutions for WSI-DICOM conversion that integrates into PACS systems connected to web-based viewers (OHIF/SLIM), but also works locally with open-source Viewers such like QuPath (newest version 0.5.0). As automatic slide analysis with AI algorithms (mostly Python) is a cornerstone of computational pathology, OpenSlide integration is another necessary requirement.'
